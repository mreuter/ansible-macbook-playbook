# Download and install Command Line Tools if no developer tools exist
#       * previous evaluation didn't work completely, due to gcc binary existing for vanilla os x install
#       * gcc output on vanilla osx box:
#       * 'xcode-select: note: no developer tools were found at '/Applications/Xcode.app', requesting install.
#       * Choose an option in the dialog to download the command line developer tools'
#
# Evaluate 2 conditions
#       * ensure dev tools are installed by checking the output of gcc
#       * check to see if gcc binary even exists ( original logic )
# if either of the conditions are met, install dev tools
